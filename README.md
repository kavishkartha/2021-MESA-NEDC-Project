# 2021-MESA-NEDC-Project
My MESA team's 2021 NEDC Project. We got 6th place overall in MESA Preliminaries :)
DISCLAIMER: Please keep in mind that this was just a fun project that me and my friends created to help our fellow students in our school district monitor any peaks in their rates and track their stress and anxiety.
            If you are genuinely concerned about your heart rate/stress/anxiety, please see a doctor and do not rely on this device. 

Parts needed to build this project:
  - Arudino Uno R3
  - 16 x 2 LCD
  - Male to Male Jumper Wries 
  - Male to Female Jumper Wires
  - 164 mm x 54 mm Breadboard (My team attached two 82 mm x 54 mm breaboards together)
  - 10k ohm Poteniometer 
  - Arduino Pulse Sensor 

There is an image of the project schematic in this repository if you want to try building this project.
